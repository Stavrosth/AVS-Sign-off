Notice from spectre during transient analysis `transient67'.
    Trapezoidal ringing is detected during tran analysis.
        Please use method=trap for better results and performance.


Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(nor10_fanout4.nor12.2:Q) = 1.229 V
I: I(VGND:p) = 189.3 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different
        in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage
        control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option
        `bin_relref=yes'.

        in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage
        control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option
        `bin_relref=yes'.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(nor10_fanout4.nor13.2:Q) = 1.497 V
I: I(VGND:p) = 287.6 uA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different
        in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage
        control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option
        `bin_relref=yes'.
